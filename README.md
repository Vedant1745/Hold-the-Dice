# Hold the Dice

This is a simple, fun, and engaging two-player dice game where the first player to reach a score of 100 wins!

## How to Play

1.  **Roll the Dice:** Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.  The number rolled gets added to your current score.

2.  **Hold:** If you're feeling lucky, keep rolling to increase your current score. But be careful! If you roll a 1, your current score resets to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.

3.  **Be Strategic:** To avoid losing your accumulated score, click "Hold" to add your current score to your total score. This will also switch the turn to the other player.

4.  **Reach 100:** The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game!
